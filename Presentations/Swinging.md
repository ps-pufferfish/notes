# Scratch notes
 - Single Gridbaglayout instead of nested layouts
 - Netbeans
 - Hardcoding pixel values is a bad idea
	 - Don't like doing them for spacing either, but I can accept it for whitespace, too hard to change
	 - if your layout isn't working without hardcoding pixel values, you've got an underlying problem
 - Theme Changing
 - Font resising
 - THE SWING THREAD!
	 - stay on it for ui stuff
	 - seriously, don't do ui stuff off the swing thread
 - separate behaviour from ui initialisation
	 - Doesn't necessarily have to be a separate controller class, but if you're defining action listeners and other gubbins alongside swing layout stuff, it's probably gonna be difficult to change.
- When you add listeners, are you removing them eventually
	- most of the time it's fine, they'll get destroyed along with the object
	- sometimes, you have a memory leak. e.g. adding window listener to parent window every time a sub window is created.
