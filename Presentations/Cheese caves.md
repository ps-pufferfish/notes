US agricultural surplus

US cheese caves
At the end of 2023, the US had 1.45 billion lbs of cheese in storage, which is worth about $3.4 billion at wholesale.

A Large part of The US government's cheese surplus is stored in a single location, a converted limestone mine in Missouri. The US Cheese caves.
Now, you might be asking, Nat, why don't they do something about it? How did it even get to this point? Now that's a very good question.



wibbly wabbly back in time
1973s - national dairy shortage in the US
	- 30% inflation on dairy products in just a few months, can't be 'avin' that
	- government intervention, Nixon suspended import quotas on certain goods, and support prices for milk were increased.
	- Milk prices reduced
1977 - Milk prices are still coming down
	- Then president Jimmy Carter tried to avoid the new crisis
	- threw money at the dairy industry to increase production.
	- Phew, another crisis averted
	- What do farmers do? They produce en masse, if people don't want milk, the government sure does.
	- What to do with all this milk the government is getting, it can't sell it or give it all away without undercutting the dairy industry. All this milk would go off while the government frantically searched for solutions. The obvious solution? CHEESE GROMIT! The temporary solution would give officials time to search for solutions to the problem it just created.
1981 - US is spending $2 billion per year on the dairy industry
	- US government now owns 560 million pounds of cheese
	- Ronald Reagan weren't for'avin' that, so public distribution began
	- "Government Cheese" given away for free by pickup to food banks, community centres, and anywhere else that might want it.

1995 - US Gov sets up Dairy Management Inc. 
	- Annual budget of $140 million, offshoot of department of agriculture
	- Purpose is to get people to consume more dairy
	- American Department of Health and Human Services conducted several studies showing dairy is not very healthy to be consumed regularly?
	- Got milk? adds
	- Milk with school lunches
	- Responsible for the introduction of the pizza hut stuffed crust
	- Dominos Bailout in 2010
	- Macdonalds moving from margerine to butter
	- Egnoring the borderline unethical practices, it was somewhat effective, and the surplus did go down a bit

2019 - The US is at it again. Storing cheese by the truckload. 
	- Demand is falling, but production is not.
	- US Dairy producers received 43 billion in 2016, accounting for 42% of all revenue.
	- Now, you might think, at least it's helping small family farms stay afloat, even if they're floating on a flood of surplus milk. But you'd be wrong. The dairy lobbies are the ones responsible for influencing the policy decisions in this direction, and the benefits are mostly gobbled up by the big companies that fund the lobby, leaving small farms stranded.

2021 - lockdown don't help, and stockpiles surge even more
	- We're way past historical highs at this point
	- The government gives out cheese as Food aid, making a small dent in the reserves

2023 - Brings us up to date, 1.5 billion lbs of cheese surplus,
	- Dairy farmers poured away nearly 227 million litres of milk in 2023
	- It seems that private interests are overtaking decision making
	- When will it stop? who knows? It shows no sign of stopping anytime soon, the logistical challenges alone are prohibitive.
