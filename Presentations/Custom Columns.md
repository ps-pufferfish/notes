Hello there folks, I'm Nat, and this fine fellow to my right is CanaDan, here to tell you to Come on down to CanaDan's Custom Column Corner Shop for the Deal of your life. 
At CanaDan's custom column corner shop, we give the users the power to take their dreams into their own hands. 
Here we can see the values just waiting to be populated. Powered by bambdas, these cells could become anything.
Why, any text is possible. "Hello", "Goodbye", answers to questions such as "What is the pro team on". 
But IT DOES NOT STOP THERE FOLKS! 
You could have Doubles. 
Dates.
Durations. 
We have booleans.
Integers
URLs
Even Arbitrary Enums.

But I can see your confusion. The most vital datatype is missing. 
But do not fear. Fear may be the mindkiller, but at Canadan's Custom Column Cornershop, we have you covered. 
That's right Folks, ICONS!
Just think of the possibilities. Trully Endless

Now I can hear you thinking. Nat. With all this power divested unto the user.
What happens if they slip up, do a so called whoopsy daisy.
For this, we have a cute lil' icon courtesy of the UX guys.
Just a quick hover over will tell you exactly where to go to see error details so you can fix it up right quick.
No fuss, no muss.

These surely be powerful tools for the users hands. This is Custom columns, powered, by Table Table. 100% bug free, and that's a guarantee, or Josh Spinder eats a hat.
