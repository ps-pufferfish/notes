Think this year was too prescribed.
Order of some things could be better

### ideas for next year
 - ***Run it as a delivery team***
 - "Objective is to create a vulnerable web app that can be used to evaluate a DAST scanner"
 - First day is setup/introduction to portswigger, getting base web app cloned and running.
	 - Maybe writing good tickets introduction
	 - Have simple tickets in board for setting up their environment, examples of good user stories, ACs etc...
 - Second day is planning meeting with scoping. They decide what to do (with guidance).
	 - When do they learn about vulnerabilities?
	 - create tickets
	 - Assign pairs
	 - Decide who works on what first
 - Probably an introduction to burpsuite pro second day.
	 - burp pro + vulnerabilities?
 - Maybe introduce enterprise third day

 - Encourage tdd if they don't bring it up themselves
 - Get pairs to accept other pair's tickets
 - How will they distribute the web app?
	 - Docker as a minimum
	 - AWS as a nice to have
 - What vulnerabilities will they add?
	 - Client side
	 - server side
	 - Networking


 - External meetings
	 - Culture team
	 - Teams
 - Jira admin permissions
 - Github accounds pre-setup
 - Timeboxing things
